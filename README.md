# Hospitalized_Patient_Prediction

Readmission rate is one of the key indicators for the hospitals to maintain their quality. In 2014, Medicare fined a record number of 2,610 hospitals for having too many patients return within a month for additional treatments.
Predicting readmission within 30 days is very critical not only for the hospitals. If a patient can see his readmission risks, he and his family can prepare and prevent unwanted readmission.
